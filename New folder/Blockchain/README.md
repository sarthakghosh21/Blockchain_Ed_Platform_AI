# Basic Blockchain using JAVA
Basic blockchain using java.

## Installation
[Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) is necessary.  
This project uses a library to handle Json called Gson. A example introduction of Gson using Maven, it would be okay to write as follows.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
  <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
  <version>2.8.2</version>
</dependency>
```

No other special installation is required. It is okay if there is an environment where Java can be compiled and executed. (I am using IntelliJ)

## Features

- [ ] P2P Mining

## Classes
### Block
  Block class is the most fundamental class in blockchain.  
  It has the following variables.
  - Index (`int`)  
    The index of that block.
  - Timestamp (`long`)  
    Unix timestamp of the time block was created.
  - Transactions (`ArrayList<Transaction >`)  
    The transactions until the end of Proof of Work is entered as ArrayList.
  - Proof (`int`)  
    The result of Proof of Work.
  - Previous Hash (`String`)  
    Hash value of the previous block. Also, the previous block also contains the previous hash value. For this reason, this hash value was generated based on all past blocks, which is exactly the continuity and invariance of blockchain.

### Transaction
  Transaction is the transaction that blocks have.  
Â  It has the following variables.
  - Sender (`String`)  
    The address of the sender of the coin.
  - Recipient (`String`)  
    The address of the recipient to send the coin.
  - Amount (`long`)  
    The amount of coins to send.

### Blockchain
  The blockchain class is the blockchain itself. This connect the block where Transaction is written like a chain.  
  It has the following variables.
  - Difficulty (`int`)  
    The difficulty of Proof of Work.
  - Transactions (`ArrayList<Transaction>`)  
    The transaction written when the next block is generated.
  - Chain (`ArrayList<Block>`)  
    A blockchain. It is the core.

## Hash
  The hash value of the block is calculated from `SHA-256`.
  ```java
  public class Block {

    ...

    public String hash() {
        return Utils.applySHA256(this.toString());
    }
  }
  ```
  The argument `input` gives the block class converted to Json style String type using Gson.

## Proof of Work
  Proof of Work is a very simple and beautiful idea. It is extremely difficult to find a valid Proof, but it is easy to determine if the requested Proof is valid or not. This is a very important property. When Proof is determined by distributed computing power (mining), the next block is generated.  
  For details about Proof of Work, please see [here](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46).  

  PoW that using here is very simple. The model expression is as follows.
  ```
  000...ab5r = SHA256(Previous proof * x)
  x is New Proof.
  ```
  When multiplied by the value x in the previous Proof, we obtain a value x such that the result obtained by hash value by SHA 256 precedes several 0s (number is Difficulty) at the beginning.  
  At this time, x is a new Proof.

  ```java
  public class Blockchain {

  ...

  public int calculatePoW(int previousProof) {
      int proof = 0;
      while(!validProof(previousProof, proof)) {
          proof += 1;
      }
      return proof;
  }

  public boolean validProof(int previousProof, int proof) {
      String target = new String(new char[difficulty]).replace('\0', '0');
      String guess = Utils.applySHA256(String.valueOf(previousProof * proof));
      return guess.substring(0, difficulty).equals(target);
  }
}
```
`validProof()`, the hash value is obtained by passing the previous Proof and the current Proof as an argument and checking whether Proof is valid.  
`calculatePoW()` will find a valid Proof from the previous Proof.

In cryptocurrency, blockchain we can not understand its true value, truth. Should we rediscover it or is it naturally appearing?  
It seems like art. When use technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchains, we fall into a sense of experience the art.
